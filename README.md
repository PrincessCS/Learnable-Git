## Version Control
Version Control is a system that records changes made to a file(s). This system also serve as a platform where users can collaborate on projects. It helps the author of a file as well as collaborators to track modifications such as revertions, additions, who made a modification, and also comparison of changes done on the file overtime. Version Control Systems generally makes the process of developing a project seamless, since it tracks and record old and new modifications, thereby allowing mistakes to be undone. There are three types of Version Control Systems; Local Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems (Perforce, Subversion), and Distributed Version Control Systems (Git, Darc, Mecurial). Git is the most popular Version Control System in use.
